This app is meant to collect data from a Jive app on our SKE instance.

Right now it is primarily a backend application meant for manipulating 
and processing usage data from that Jive app.

Data to collect:

 - Clicks per call for all users
 - Clicks per call per users
 - Type of elements most frequently clicked
 - Average clicks per call
 - Between Date X and Date Y
 - Avg. MM tabs / docs clicked per call
 - Avg Search per call
 - Total Docs accessed (Search and Docs) and per call
 - Compare agents performance over X amount of time
 - The post-call form can be used to build a more accurate search
 - This data alongside empower should give fantastic insights
